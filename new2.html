        <h2>Causes and Effects</h2>
        <p>1. Inflation - higher prices mean that they can no longer buy food and have to go hungry. There is simply nothing left for food. </p>
        <p>2. Climate Change - areas with extreme temperatures, little to no water, droughts, floods, and
		greater CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere can affect farms and their crops.</p>
		<p>3. Food Shortages - less food = more hungry people.

        <h2>How to help?</h2>
        <p>1. Donation - according to USDA, Donating wholesome food for human consumption diverts
		food waste from landfills and puts food on the table for families in need. This means donations can help
		people fight world hunger.</p>
		<p>2. Fight Pollution - pollution can cause climate change. Climate change can cause crops to dry out, leading to
		less food. Fighting pollution can help avoid more of these events.
